I use scratch text files to keep track of stuff, here is a sample of a note I
left for myself:

Volumes or DB full/not working, no space left on device
Way to see volumes:
df -h
Running the following got a lot of space available, didn't touch some volumes.
Run this while in the container.
docker system prune -a --volumes
I ran make migrate (docker-compose exec web python3.11 manage.py migrate)
