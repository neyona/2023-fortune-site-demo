# 2023-fortune-site-demo
This is a sanitized version of the setup for my underwaterfortunes.com site. I've removed passwords and such and left in items that I do not usually push to my remote repository before deployment. I also removed things like favicons but left placeholders.

This repository might be useful to you if you are making a Django, React, Docker, Webpack site. The React part of the site is in the ui_frontend section.
